# pagoda-antenna design by maarten

I just took fishpepper's python script and modified it to fit 6 complete antennas per 10cm x 10cm panel.  
There are 6 versions to choose from:  
6 x rhcp  
6 x lhcp  
3 x rhcp + 3 x lhcp  
with or without mousebites

DO NOT RUN THIS using python2, use python3 instead!

NOTE:
untested, use at your own risk!
